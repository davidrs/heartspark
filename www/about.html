				<h2>Defibrillator Tips</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Defibs are so simple that untrained 6th graders can use them.</li>
					<li>It is always better to try and get a defib than to do nothing.</li>
					<li>Learn where the nearest defib is at your place of work, home, and gym.</li>
					<li>Chance of survival drops 7-10% every min without defib. Hurry!</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>About the App</h2>
				<p>This app is a defibrillator mapping game. You play by updating and editing defibrillator listings and earning points. Unlock badges, move up the leaderboard, and occasionally win prizes.</p>
				<p>We do our best to ensure quality data, but cannot make any guarantees about our app's data. It is pre-populated with 380 defibrillators from the City of Ottawa's open data, and then annotated and improved by app users like yourself.</p>

Your location is only submitted when you explicitly submit it for amending the location of a defibrillator. If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
